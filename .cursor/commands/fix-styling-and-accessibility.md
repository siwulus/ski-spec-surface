Review the component's Tailwind CSS classes to ensure they conform to the project's style and accessibility guidelines.

- Update styling to use only standardized Tailwind tokens, spacing scales, color classes, variants, and state/dark mode utilities as defined in the project's Tailwind configuration and styling rules.
- Validate that all visual updates are accessible: check adherence to project ARIA practices, ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards, and confirm that all interactive elements provide appropriate roles, labels, focus rings, and state indicators for screen reader users and keyboard navigation.
