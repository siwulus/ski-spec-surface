Implement the plan.
Follow this execution pattern:

1. Implement up to **three steps** from the implementation plan.
   Briefly **summarize what was done** and **outline the next three planned actions**.
   **Stop at this point and wait for my feedback.**

2. If feedback is provided, **apply any requested changes** to the already executed steps.

3. If there are still remaining steps in the plan, **repeat the process**.
